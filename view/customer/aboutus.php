<h2>L0 Series Maglev: 374 mph</h2>
This Japanese train, which is currently being developed and tested by the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), holds the land speed record for rail vehicles, clocking in at 374 mph. While it may be tempting to book a ticket to Tokyo, keep in mind that this train is still being developed for regular commercial use. The first segment (Tokyo to Nagoya) is set to open in 2027, before being expanded to Osaka. When completed, the L0 Series will run at a maximum operating speed of 310 mph, making the trip from Tokyo's Shinagawa Station to Osaka (over 300 miles) in one hour and seven minutes.

The L0 Series technology, called maglev (magnetic levitation train), actually makes the train levitate at speeds exceeding around 93 mph. The technology is currently being employed worldwide (see see number four), and there are talks of it being used for a train between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.
